## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper titled "Towards Boosting Out-of-Distribution Detection from a Spatial Feature Importance Perspective", which has been accepted by IJCV2025. The document provides examples on how to use the interpretability methods discussed in the paper, demonstrates the ROAD faithfulness evaluation method, and showcases our Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach based on spatial feature purification.

## Setup Instructions

### Models

Please create a new folder named `shared_models` in the current directory. You will need to download the models used in our experiments from the following link:

- **Extraction Code**: mode

### Datasets

Given the large size of the datasets, we have compressed them into multiple parts. Follow these steps to prepare the datasets:

1. Create a new directory named `datasets`.
2. Download all compressed parts from the link provided below:
